#The Harmonic Oscillator

The Harmonic Oscillator is the second quantum model we will see which can be solved exactlly. As a rationalization for creating this model, we can determine what is oscillating in a chemical system. The answer is bond between atoms, so we can model vibrations of chemical bonds using the Harmonic Oscillator model.

##Creating the Model

First, imagine a mass, $$m$$ , connected to a spring, lying along the x-axis, with the other end of the spring connected to an immovable wall. At equillibrium, the mass will be at a constant value of x, we can set this arbitraily to be the point x=0. However, by pulling the mass in one direction, the spring can be displaced by some amount, $$x$$. The 'restoring' force to return the spring to equilibrium after displacement, $$F_1$$ , is proportional to the displacement, $$x$$, where the proportionality factor is known as the spring constant, $$k_f$$.Also, the restoring force is in the opposite direction of the displacement, so it is negative. We now have:

$$F_{1}=-k_{f}x$$

In the absence of any other external forces, Newton's second law states that this force must be equal to the mass, $$m$$, times its acceleration, $$a$$.

$$\begin{align}
F_{1} &= -k_{f}x = ma
-k_{f}x &= ma
\end{align}$$

Rewriting acceleration as the second derivative of position, with respect to time, yields a linear second order differential equation:

$$\begin{align}
-k_{f}x &= m \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}}
m \frac{d^{2}x}{dt^{2}} + k_{f}x = 0
\end{align}$$

We can employ the same method for solving linear second order differential equation that we have been using so far. We will take the trial wave function $$x(t)$$ and substitute it into our differential equation.

Note:
$$\begin{align}
x(t) &= Nsin(2 \pi \nu t) \hspace{1cm} \nu = \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k_{f}}{m}}
\frac{d^{2}x(t)}{dt^{2}} &= N \frac{d}{dt} \frac{2\pi}{2\pi} \sqrt{\frac{k_{f}}{m}} cos(2 \pi \frac{1}{2\pi} \sqrt{k_{f}}{m} t)
&= \frac{-k_{f}}{m} N sin(2 \pi \nu t)
\end{align}$$

Where $$N$$ is the normailzation constant and $$\nu$$ is the frequency of oscillation.

Substituting into our differential equation yields:
$$\begin{align}
m \frac{d^{2}x(t)}{dt^{2}} + k_{f}x(t) &= 0
m (\frac{-k_{f}}{m} N sin (2 \pi \nu t)) + k_{f} (Nsin(2 \pi \nu t)) &= 0
-k_{f}N sin(2 \pi \nu t) + k_{f}N sin(2 \pi \nu t) &= 0
0 &= 0
\end{align}$$

So our trial wavefunction holds for the conditions we have created so far.
Next, we need to use our wavefunction to solve the Schrödinger Equation. Recall the full form of the Schrödinger Equation:

$$\frac{-\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2} \Psi (x) + V(x) \Psi (x) = E \Psi (x)$$
