# The Radial Wavefunctions of the Hydrogenic Atom
The **Radial Wavefunction**, $$R(r)$$, described how an electron's behavior changes with its distance ($$r$$) from the nucleus. Unlike the <span class="blue bold">Radial Distribution Function</span>[^1] ($$P(r)$$) which tells us the *probability of finding an electron at a given radius*, $$R(r)$$ is the mathematical function whose square gives the *probability density* at that point.

Solving the Schrödinger Equation
{: .label .section-label .label-green }
> The first step in solving the Schrödinger equation ($$\hat{H} \psi = E \psi$$) for a hydrogenic atom (ie. a nucleus with charge $$Ze$$ and one electron) is to simplify the complex Hamiltonian ($$\hat{H}$$)
