Copy "template.md" to get started. 
Rename the file and keep the ".md" file suffix. Change the "title" property in the header.
Leave one blank line after the "---" that closes the header, add everything you want visible below this blank line!
Once you're ready to publish your page and view it on the website, removed the "nav_exclude" line in the header and move the file to the root folder.
