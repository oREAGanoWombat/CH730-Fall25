For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the Schrodinger equation is $$H\psi + V\psi= E\psi$$, where $$H=$$ $$\frac{-ℏ^2}{2m} ∇^2$$, $$V=$$ $$\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$, and $$\psi$$ is the particle's wave function.

Thus, with these definitions included, the equation is

$$\frac{-ℏ^2}{2m} ∇^2\psi + \frac{1}{2}kx^2\psi= E\psi$$

The solution to this equation is in the form

$$\psi_v(x) = N_vH_v(y)e^\frac{-y^2}{2}$$

where $$y = \frac{x}{\alpha}$$ and $$\alpha = (\frac{ℏ^2}{mk_f})^\frac{1}{4}$$.

---> discuss how the polynomials differ at v=0 and how the eigenvalue will change depending on v. Give example derivation for v=0 as we did in class.
