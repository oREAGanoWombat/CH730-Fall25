For a quantum harmonic oscillator, the Schrodinger equation is $$H\psi + V\psi= E\psi$$, where $$H=$$ $$\frac{-ℏ^2}{2m} ∇^2$$, $$V=$$ $$\frac{1}{2}kx^2$$, and $$\psi$$ is the particle's wave function.

Thus, with these definitions included, the equation is

$$\frac{-ℏ^2}{2m} ∇^2\psi + \frac{1}{2}kx^2\psi= E\psi$$

The solution to this equation is in the form

$$\psi_v(x) = N_vH_v(y)e^\frac{-y^2}{2}$$

where $$y = \frac{x}{\alpha}$$, $$\alpha = (\frac{ℏ^2}{mk_f})^\frac{1}{4}$$, and $$N_v$$ is the normalization constant 

$$N_v =\frac{1}{\alpha\pi^\frac{1}{2}2^vv!}$$

$$H_v$$, however, has multiple expressions based on the frequency $$v$$, shown in the table below:

Thus, depending on the value of $$v$$, the formula of the wave function



---> discuss how the polynomials differ at v=0 and how the eigenvalue will change depending on v. Give example derivation for v=0 as we did in class.
