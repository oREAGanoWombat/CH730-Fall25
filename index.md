# Overview of Foundational and Advanced Topics in Physical Chemistry
This website was created by Fall 2025 CH 730 students at North Carolina State University. The instructor for the course, Dr. Thomas Theis, chose to make this website as a means of creating further discussion on course topics and spreading our notes and knowledge with the public. Much of this website references Atkins' Physical Chemistry 11e[^1], the assigned textbook for CH 730.
