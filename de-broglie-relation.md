# de Broglie Relation
In **classical** mechanics, the momentum of a particle $$p$$ can be found by finding the product of a particle's mass $$m$$ and the particle's velocity $$v$$:

$$p = m \cdot v$$

The **quantum** definition of particle momentum takes **Planck's constant** $$h$$ and divides it by the wavelength $$\lambda$$:

$$p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$$

### Let's take a look at how we find this definition...

#### Recall Functions for Kinetic Energy $$E$$
> $$\begin{align}
> E & = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2} \\
> E & = mc^{2} \\
> E & = h\nu
> \end{align}$$
From the above equation for speed of light, we can find a formula for frequency $$\nu$$

$$c=\lambda \cdot \nu \Rightarrow \nu = \frac{c}{\lambda}$$

We can now use this in our eqations for energy

$$E=h \left( \frac{c}{\lambda} \right) = mc^{2} \Rightarrow mc = \frac{h}{\lambda} = p$$

<u>Thus the *de Broglie Relation* is writted as</u>

$$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$$

> This relation only becomes meaningful for very small objects (such as particles) as it breaks classical mechanics. Wavelengths of tangible objects are so small that they aren't relevant to consider when determining momentum.
