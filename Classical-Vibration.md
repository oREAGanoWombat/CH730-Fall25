# Hooke's Law
Let's imagine a ball with mass $$m$$ attached to an immovable wall by a spring. The only force that acts upon the ball is the force exerted by the spring.

The force applied on the ball by the spring can be described by the equation $$F=-k_{f}x$$. $$k_{f}$$ is the force constant of the spring which is dependant on the spring itself and $$x$$ describes the position of the ball in relation to the spring's equilibrium point $$(x=0)$$. This intuitively makes sense. As you pull the ball in the $$+x$$ direction away from the wall, the spring resists pulling it back in the $$-x$$ direction and vise versa. 

The force can also be described using Newton's second law of motion as $$F=ma$$. When combined with the spring equation, we get the following equation relating the ball's position

In-line math looks like this $$y=2x^{2}$$.
