# Waves & Euler Formulas
Wave functions are typically denoted by the Greek letter psi $$\psi$$ and are made up of a spatial frequency variable $$k$$ and a variable that represents 1-dimensional space $$x$$.

## Consider the function for a sine wave $$\psi_{1}$$

> $$\psi_{1} = sin(kx)$$

> For $$k=1$$, the plot of $$\psi_{1}$$ from $$x[0,2\pi]$$ looks like \

> A higher value of $$k$$ (say $$k=3$$) changes the plot of $$\psi_{1}$$ as such \

### Waves aren't only sine waves. Some examples of other wave functions are

$$\begin{align}
\psi_{2} & = cos(kx) \\
\psi_{3} & = cos(kx) + isin(kx)
\end{align}$$

## Recall Euler's Formula

$$e^{ix} = cos(x) + isin(x)$$

### Thus the above wave functions can be rewritten in terms of their real and imaginary parts:

$$\begin{align}
\psi_{1} & = sin(kx) \\
    & = \frac{e^{ikx}-e^{-ikx}}{2i} \\
\psi_{2} & = cos(kx) \\
    & = \frac{e^{ikx}+e^{-ikx}}{2} \\
\psi_{3} & = cos(kx) + isin(kx) \\
    & = e^{ikx}
\end{align}$$
